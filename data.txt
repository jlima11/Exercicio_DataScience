A. Exploratory Data Analysis
– 1. Read, clean and explore the received data. Explain each step and
why.

Steps: 
(1) undestanding all datas, to take decisions about importance and redundance
(2) manipulating the data  
(3) substituing null datas 
(4) transform categorical data in int value.
(5) droping outliers
 
– 2. What’s the distribution for customer total debt variable? Draw a
histogram. How should you group this variable?	

The distribution is fisher distribution, where 

– 3. Analyze the “collected” variable correlating it to separate variables.
Plot this information.

B. Feature selection

– 1. Select the top 3-6 variables you consider that may be most
important for root-cause analysis. Explain your considerations.
1° collected, because is the principal information to undertand if the debt was paid.
2° disconnection_executed, understand if the method was efficient
3° total_debt, unsderstand how much is the cost of the debt, becouse a big debit have more chances to not be paid.
4° regional, we can see difference in bad debt collected by region.
5° total_bills, more bills increase the chance of bad debt don't be payed
6°
– 2. Are there any kind of preprocessing needed for these variables? Do
that if so.
In Categorical data, is necessary transform strings in number, so the best decision is creat a new columns, with numbers correspondents.
